# Planetos

_Planetos_ brings to your iPhone an **immersive high-definition photographic dive** into nature.

Open the app each day to discover a new set of original photography that is designed to put you in the state of flow.

## Designed for relaxation & creative stimulation

Zone-out and let your mind drift through animated visual sequences of **true-to-nature full resolution** quality imagery.

Creativity flows when your mind is free from stress and anxiety of the modern world. Nothing induces that better than mother nature. Allow yourself a 5-10 minute session to discover that precious feeling.

## Take inspired notes

Whenever you‘re experiencing a **flow on inspiration** write a quick note for yourself by returning the app to portrait view and tapping on ”Write a Note” in the main menu (top left corner).

All notes are stored in **your iCloud account** and are truly yours, no external storage involved.

## Original photography

All photographs are **taken & processed exclusively for this app** by myself, the author of the Planetos app. No stock photography of any kind is being used.

Regular nature photography has been the source of my inspiration for a number of years and I want to share that feeling with you.
