# Mission statement

Telling stories of data movements in time. Not many words, instead a cockpit view of changes and navigation hints. It is not about quantified self, rather about quantified world in which some factors change really fast while others seem to be too slow to register themselves in human awareness. There has to be a connection between macro world and micro events. Perhaps not possible to formulate but fascinating to track and attempt to objectify.
