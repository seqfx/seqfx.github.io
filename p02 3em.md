## Activating the third eye

Learn how to relax and destress using your “third eye” centre of energy. The app teaches your the process of activation of the third eye — the energy centre between the eyebrows. The third eye is the classical gateway to experience of transcendental peace, calm and wellbeing.

The third eye meditation is one of the most simple yet immensely effective meditative techniques. The third eye centre of energy is always with you — simply close your eyes and it will readily activate itself. It’s an easy practice for alleviating stress and anxiety, bringing the state of wellbeing and relaxation.

The app is a gentle yet thorough step-by-step introduction to the principles behind the third eye meditation. By following the sequence of daily guided meditations, you will learn the art of activating the energy centre at your forehead and experiencing a range of modalities of consciousness that await for you in that wondrous gateway of the transcendent mind.

## Foundational course

The app provides a sequence of regular meditations that are designed to awaken your perception of subtle energies of the third eye.

The meditation is best done in a vertical sitting position (on a chair or cross-legged) with the phone positioned horizontally in front of you.
